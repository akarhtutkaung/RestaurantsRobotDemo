## Summary 
This study addresses the challenges of understaffing and overcrowding experienced by both employees and customers. To alleviate these issues, the potential of using robots as servers is explored, aiming to reduce the workload on human workers while meeting customers' demands. However, for a robot to effectively navigate and serve in a restaurant setting, it requires a reliable path-finding algorithm. The study compares the performance of the Dijkstra and A* path-finding algorithms in a simulated restaurant environment, utilizing Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) and Voronoi diagram algorithms to map all possible routes. Evaluation criteria include time taken, path length, and the occurrence of collisions during the route. The paper concludes by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each path-finding and path-planning algorithm in the context of restaurant robots.
